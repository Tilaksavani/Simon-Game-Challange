# Simon Game Challenge

This repository holds the code for a web-based Simon Game challenge! Test your memory and rhythm as you try to replicate increasingly complex sequences of colored lights and sounds.

### About the Game

Inspired by the classic Simon game, this challenge features colored buttons that light up and play sounds in a specific sequence. Players must then tap the buttons in the correct order to progress. With each successful round, the sequence gets longer, challenging your memory and reflexes.

### Features

* **Visual and Audio Cues:** Colored buttons illuminate and play sounds to represent the sequence.
* **Progressive Difficulty:** The game starts with simple sequences and gradually increases in length as you succeed.
* **Scorekeeping:** Tracks your highest score achieved during gameplay.

### Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
   - Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (helpful for customization)

2. **Running the Project:**
   - Open `index.html` (or the main HTML file) in your web browser.

3. **Playing the Game:**
   - Click the "Start Game" button to begin.
   - Watch and memorize the sequence of colored buttons that light up.
   - Once the sequence finishes, tap the buttons in the exact order they were shown.
   - If you succeed, the sequence gets longer for the next round.
   - A wrong button press or exceeding the time limit results in a game over.

### Customization (Optional)

This is a basic setup. You can further personalize the game by:

* Adding different sound effects for each button.
* Implementing difficulty levels with varying sequence lengths and speeds.
* Creating visual animations for button presses.
* Including a visual representation of the sequence for easier memorization (optional).

**Note:** Customization requires knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Technologies Used

* HTML: Defines the structure and content of the web page.
* CSS: Styles the visual appearance of the game elements like buttons and score display.
* JavaScript: Handles game logic, generating random sequences, playing sounds, evaluating user input, and updating the score.
